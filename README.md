# Anophelesgambiae-population-modelling-2022

Discription of the Anophelesgambiae population modelling 2022.

In this project the main goal is to see what the effect is of genetically modified mosquitoes (Frankenstein mosquitoes) on the population. 
The Frankenstein mosquitoes have a gene drive and a gene what gives them immunity to the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The gene drive makes inheritance of the gene from immunity better. The gene drive inheritance to the off-spring. The females lay Frankenstein eggs if they are also a Frankenstein mosquito or if they mate with a Frankenstein male. The gene drive inheritance with 100%. 
There is also the ecology of the mosquito modelled. An important example is de food competition of the larvae. 
There are 4 stages modelled: egg, larva, pupa and adult.
Here only adult have a age dependent mortality. With the other stages they are constant on age. With larvae there is also a mortality what is dependent of the density.    The climate which is used is Sao Tome. It is important because temperature have big influence on poikilothermic (cold-blooded) organismes. Mosquitoes are poikilothermic. 
The land where the mosquitoes live is a grasfield with a lake, village and swarmcenter. In the lake lives the aquatic stages: egg, larva and pupa. In the village females take blood from a human if they laid eggs. Only if females have blood they can lay eggs after mating. The swarmcenter is a bush where the mosquitoes swarm each day. 
To see the effect of the Frankenstein mosquitoes two parameters are changed in each run: the fitness of the Frankenstein mosquito and the proportion of mosquitoes who have a gene drive at the beginning, thus t=0. Here 1 year is modelled and there is the proportion of mosquitoes who have a gene drive tracked to see how the proportion changes from the beginning (t=0) to the end of the year.
